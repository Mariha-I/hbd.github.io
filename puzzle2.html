            <p class="text">Happy Birthday! It's kinda crazy that it's only been 3 months.
                Congratulations on 19!! I know you don't celebrate your birthday like
                crazy or anything, but it's your first one away from home, so I was hoping
                it could maybe be something you look back on positively in a few years. You 
                are such an awesome person, and you deserve so much love and appreciation. 
                From all your awesome make-up moments to the way your face lit up whenever you saw 
                a cute animal to even the mundane moments where you managed to make everyone smile, 
                thank you again and again for sharing bits of your life with us all and for being 
                who you are :>>. I hope you have the best year ever! Thanks for playing :>
